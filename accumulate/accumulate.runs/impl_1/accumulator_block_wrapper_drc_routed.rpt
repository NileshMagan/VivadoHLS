2. REPORT DETAILS

DPOP-3#1 Warning
PREG Output pipelining  
DSP accumulator_block_i/hls_macc_0/inst/tmp_1_fu_57_p2__0 output accumulator_block_i/hls_macc_0/inst/tmp_1_fu_57_p2__0/P[47:0] is not pipelined (PREG=0). Pipelining the DSP48 output will improve performance and often saves power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this DSP48 function was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set the PREG attribute to 1.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-4#1 Warning
MREG Output pipelining  
DSP accumulator_block_i/hls_macc_0/inst/tmp_1_fu_57_p2 multiplier stage accumulator_block_i/hls_macc_0/inst/tmp_1_fu_57_p2/P[47:0] is not pipelined (MREG=0). Pipelining the multiplier function will improve performance and will save significant power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this multiplier was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If there is no registered adder/accumulator following the multiply function, two pipeline stages are suggested to allow both the MREG and PREG registers to be used.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set both the MREG and PREG attributes to 1 when performing multiply functions.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-4#2 Warning
MREG Output pipelining  
DSP accumulator_block_i/hls_macc_0/inst/tmp_1_fu_57_p2__0 multiplier stage accumulator_block_i/hls_macc_0/inst/tmp_1_fu_57_p2__0/P[47:0] is not pipelined (MREG=0). Pipelining the multiplier function will improve performance and will save significant power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this multiplier was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If there is no registered adder/accumulator following the multiply function, two pipeline stages are suggested to allow both the MREG and PREG registers to be used.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set both the MREG and PREG attributes to 1 when performing multiply functions.

DPOP-4#3 Warning
MREG Output pipelining  
DSP accumulator_block_i/hls_macc_0/inst/tmp_1_reg_99_reg__0 multiplier stage accumulator_block_i/hls_macc_0/inst/tmp_1_reg_99_reg__0/P[47:0] is not pipelined (MREG=0). Pipelining the multiplier function will improve performance and will save significant power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.

REQP-1774#1 Warning
RAMB36E2_WRITE_WIDTH_A_18_doesnt_use_WEA32  
The RAMB36E2 cell accumulator_block_i/microblaze_0_local_memory/lmb_bram/U0/inst_blk_mem_gen/gnbram.gnative_mem_map_bmg.native_mem_map_blk_mem_gen/valid.cstr/ramloop[0].ram.r/prim_noinit.ram/DEVICE_8SERIES.WITH_BMM_INFO.TRUE_DP.SIMPLE_PRIM36.SERIES8_TDP_SP36_NO_ECC_ATTR.ram has WRITE_WIDTH_A set to 18.
